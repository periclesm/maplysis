A simple Swift iOS app using MapKit and Geocoding to display information and map functionality.

This is a usecase application with basic functionality and can be used as a starting point for building your ideas and services.

The app uses Geocoders (forward & reverse) by Apple and Google Maps:
	* Apple geocoder is part of CoreLocation Framework
	* Google geocoder information can be found at https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/start
	
**Important note:** Google Geocoder uses Google Maps Platform APIs. This requires you have a valid API key to request from the service and retrieve data. For obvious reasons, I have not included any key in the app and running any Google geocoding functionality will fail. To learn and get your keys, see https://developers.google.com/maps/gmp-get-started
