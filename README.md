This is a map use-case application with basic functionality and can be used as a starting point for building ideas and services based on maps and location. Is written in Swift and using MapKit and CoreLocation frameworks to display information and map functionality. Just tap on the map to show the selected address and location coordinates.

The app uses Geocoders (forward & reverse):
* Apple geocoder is part of CoreLocation Framework
* Google Maps geocoder (more information at https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/start)
* Bing Maps geocoder (more info at https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/maps/bing-maps/location-recognition)
	
**Important note:** Google Maps and Bing Maps Geocoder in this use-case app uses Google Maps and Bing Maps Platform respectively. This requires a valid API key to request from the service and retrieve data. For obvious reasons, I have not included any key in the app and running any Google or Bing geocoding functionality will fail. To learn and get your keys, visit the links above.

A compiled and running version of this app is available on TestFlight (https://testflight.apple.com/join/SQhZ1OCf)
